**ATTENTION!** To address many issues that have come up over the years, the API in v2.0.0 is different from the original React addon.

**If you are migrating from `react-addons-transition-group` and `react-addons-css-transition-group`, [read the documentation for 1.x branch instead](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable) which is a drop-in replacement and is still actively maintained.**

You can also send pull requests with 1.x bugfixes against the `v1-stable` branch.
